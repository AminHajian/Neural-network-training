# Training a neural network with Adaline method 

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the Adline algorithm, which is a type of linear regression model. The Adline model is trained using the gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal weights and bias for a given dataset. The model aims to separate data points into two classes by learning a linear decision boundary.
